## Hey, I'm Haardik ðŸ‘‹

### I'm a 24 year old software engineer with an interest in learning as much as I can.

I help run [LearnWeb3](https://learnweb3.io) to help students from all around the world upskill themselves into learning about technologies that are going to change the world while maintaining as low a barrier of entry as possible.

I also hack around and build random stuff a lot. Check out [haardik.dev](https://haardik.dev) for a timeline.
